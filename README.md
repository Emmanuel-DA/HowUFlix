In this Project, we will create an application that uniquely designs a video playlist for students based off of three factors:

    -The amount of free time that they have to watch a movie or set of tv-shows
    -The ratings that they given to previous shows
    -What genres of shows they want to watch. 
    
We will use the FavoriteTVShowMovies.txt File that was created (which can also be found in this repo) as basis of tvshows/movies to draw from. 

This project will incorporate a Searching & Sorting technique. 

It will also make use of the try, catch, and throw statements to gracefully handle errors.
